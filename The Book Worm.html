		<p> Welcome to the Bookworm! This website is designed to help you easily choose your next read. Everytime I read a book, I write a review right here on this site to help other readers spend their time reading meaningful books that they will enjoy.</p>
		<p> First things first, you should probably know what genres of books I enjoy, which can be seen in the table below. The table provides the genre, a rating of the genre on a scale of 1 to 10, (in my opinion), my favorite book from that genre, and it's author.</p>
		<p> I have been reading for as long as I can remember. Everytime that I finish a book, I place it in its rightful spot on my bookshelf, which is alphabetical order. Then, I fill out my reading journal to record my thoughts on the book before I forget. I normally read one or two books in a week, so needless to say, my bookshelf is overflowing. I like it this way however; I believe that it adds charm to my room and is interesting to look at. An empty bookshelf is like an empty box of goldfish: dusty and boring. So I have made a promise to myself to never stop reading, and I hope that one day I will have a library in my house that is filled from wall to wall with books.</p>
		<p> <small>If after you navigate my website, and give some of my suggestions a try, but do not agree with my opinions, try visiting <a href="http://bookcritics.org/">www.bookcritics.org</a> to see what they have to say.</small></p>

		<p><small><sup>[1]</sup>Historical Fiction is my favorite genre, so most of the books I read are historical fiction, but may also qualify as romance, mystery, etc.</small></p>
